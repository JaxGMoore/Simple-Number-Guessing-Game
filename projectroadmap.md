1. Create ReadME after using a prior ReadME as example - DONE
2. Assign Members to tasks (only me) - DONE
3. Find related repository, evaluate, and test it - https://github.com/prateekkalra/guess-game (Played the game; works perfectly!) 
4. (2nd Repository) https://github.com/kying18/guess-the-number/blob/master/main.py - DONE
5. Search for it and clone - DONE
6. Attempted to run code - Success!
7. Change interface personalization to cater towards me (Make the game harder(100 to 200) and interface show me as the creator) - Done (Jackson's Guessing Game)
8. Rewrote some parts of the code for better understanding
9. Right now, the interface tracks the number of tries but does not limit them - Changed to kill the program after 10 tries
    I also changed the code to allow the user to see how many tries they have remaining
10. The code doesn't properly track the time remaining at all - 1/2
    Step 1: Include Tracking Measurement - Fixed (Rewrote Code to Include datetime to provide tracking)
    Step 2: Incorporate a countdown measurement - In Progress (The code stays the same at 29 and what i assume is the amount of time it took to launch the interface)
10. Change killing the program after 10 tries to telling the user they did not win and stopping input - In Progress
